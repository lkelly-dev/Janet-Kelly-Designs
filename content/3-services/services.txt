##Consultations
During the consultation we will sit down and discuss your style, how you use this space now and how you plan to use this space in the future. KellyDesigns will then brainstorm with you and create the best plan to jump start your redesign, renovation or home staging project.

##Redesign
Frustrated with the look or furniture layout of a certain room but can’t seem to figure out why it’s not working for you? KellyDesigns can rework the layout and give you a fresh new look using your existing furniture and accessories. We start by clearing everything out of the room and sorting it all in an adjacent room. Slowly we bring back the furniture one by one and try new arrangements as we do. With the home owner’s permission we will shop other rooms for items that can be used in the redesign. If we can’t find the final pieces in your home we will leave you with a list of suggestions on what is needed or we can shop for you.
*$500 per room*

##Space Planning-Research-Shopping
KellyDesigns can help you with your interior and exterior project. Visualizing a space, its potential, its limitations and attributes is a crucial component of the design process. Understanding how to attain the best function comes with years of experience and planning expertise. We can figure out the scale of the furniture that will fit into your new home before you place the order. With careful measurements and attention to architectural detail we will produce a computerized rendering with several design options to present.
KellyDesigns can search out the best bath fixtures for the new bathroom renovation or find that funky lamp that is needed to finish off the room. We are available to do the shopping with you or for you if you desire.
*$100 per hour*

##Project Management

KellyDesigns will be there to assist in all aspects of the implementation phase of your project. Whether to consult with contractors on material choices, on the fly changes or overcoming those unforeseen construction issues you can count on us to work with your crew or one of our preferred partners.
