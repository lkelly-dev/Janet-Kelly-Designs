##Consultation
Our initial consultation is the first step in the design process.  We will sit down with you and discuss your overall style preferences, your current use of your space and your ideas for use of this space in the future. KellyDesigns will then brainstorm with you to create the best overall plan for your redesign, renovation or home-staging project.
*FEE:  $100.00 for a generous one hour consult*

##Interior Design
Are you ready for a change? Whether you wish to add a few items to a space or to proceed with a complete makeover, KellyDesigns can guide you. We can help you choose cabinets, flooring, appliances, lighting, paint, bedding and other furnishings. We have experience in room design as well as whole-house renovations. Utilizing a professional will provide you with a fresh perspective and help you to realize the potential of your space. We work with highly skilled, professional tradespeople and can either provide you with service recommendations or oversee the entire project for you.
*FEE:    Project dependent*

##Redesign
Have you been frustrated with the overall look or layout of a room or space, but simply cannot determine why the space is not working for you? KellyDesigns will reconfigure your space and provide you with a new perspective, using your existing furniture and accessories. We begin by emptying the room to establish a fresh canvas. We then determine which of your belongs should be reintroduced into the space and which should not. With the homeowners permission we will also shop the rest of the home to find items which can be incorporated into the redesign. If necessary,  we will either provide you with a list of items to needed to  complete the room design, or alternatively, we are available to shop for these items for you.
*FEE:  $500.00 per room*

##Space Planning-Research-Shopping
KellyDesigns can help you with interior or exterior home projects. A crucial part of the design process is examining a space and then visualizing its potential as well as realizing its limitations. Our long experience with planning and design allows us to understand the best function for your space. We determine the layout,  the color scheme and the most appropriate scale of furnishings for your home. After careful measuring and close attention to architectural detail, we will produce a computerized rendering of the design plan, complete with several design options. Once the design is chosen,  we are also available to source out the material or purchase your furnishings and fixtures with you.
*FEE:  $100.00 per hour*

##Project Management
Visualizing and designing a project is only the beginning of the process. Careful and professional implementation of the project design is crucial to a successful outcome and a satisfied client. KellyDesigns is involved in all aspects of the implementation phase of your project.  This includes  both long-term planning and negotiation of on-site or unforeseen changes or construction issues.
*FEE:  $100 per hour*

##Home Staging
The goal of home staging is to present your property in the best light in order to attract multiple home buyers and, ultimately, get the biggest return on your home investment. We review each of the rooms in your home and generate a plan for the optimum presentation of each room. There are two service options available to the homeowner.  We can provide you with a list of changes or adjustments to each room to allow you to institute the changes on your own. Alternatively, we will do the staging for you. The original furnishings can be used or we can arrange for the delivery and installation of rental furniture/furnishings to give your home a temporary update and showcase it for maximum resale value.
*FEES:*
*Recommendations/Consultation alone:   $100 per hour*
*Kelly Design- provided staging of furnishings:   Dependent upon house size  ( Average price is $500 per main living floors of house)*

##Curb Appeal
Curb appeal is all- important to a home’s presentation.  This holds true whether you wish to provide a warm welcome to your family and guests or if you are planning to put your home on the market. Real-estate professionals agree that good curb appeal both attracts multiple potential buyers and sets the tone for the remainder of the house tour. KellyDesigns works to coordinate design elements of your home’s exterior with its surrounding landscape.
*FEE:  $100 per hour plus materials*

##Landscape Design
KellyDesigns’ origins are in landscape design and we have designed and overseen the implementation of numerous landscape projects in the Metrowest area. Our services include hardscape design (walkways, patios, pool surrounds, stone walls, fire pits) as well as softscape design ( garden beds, trees, shrubs, flowers, grasses) and installation.
